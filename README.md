# FOOTBALL FIELD FINDER

## INTRODUCTION
This is a part-time intern project that I choose during my internship at TechDojo.org in 2021. What I felt about the internship is, our mentors and Sensei are trying to show a glimpse of the Full Stack Development World. This was mostly self-learning period where we used to show and discuss our progress with our mentors. 

## IDEA
It's a bit of a story that I tell everyone. On the day of project Idea submission, I was going to play football by an auto-rickshaw and presenting online. My first idea about Hotel Management got rejected directly and out of nowhere I came up with an idea of a website which will help the footballers to find available football field nearby. Target area is firstly Dhaka.
